# Haptic-Tool-Development

Computers these days are advance enough to allow users to create a 3D world that is similar to our own world around us. Such a virtual world can be enhanced to mimic the real world even further with the help of an artificial support technology called Haptics. A haptic interface is a device that allows a user to interact with a computer by receiving tactile and force feedback. So when it comes to the Razer Devices, Razer has developed various haptic hardwares, falling under the umbrella term “Razer Sensa HD Haptics”. These hardware platform specially works with their unique software called Interhaptics SDK (Software Development Kit).

These Haptic Hardwares features:
Higher definition haptics
More precise and wider range of haptic frequencies, allowing more unique haptic sensations
Multi-directional haptics
Multiple actuators in each device can selectively vibrate to create a spatial experience
Multi-device haptics
Multiple haptic devices able to sync with one another to create a full-body haptic experience.

The Linear Interpolation map purpose’s: is used to allow us to test the quality of the Haptic Interpolation from one body part to the next. We can easily add different kinds of Haptic Effects, Functions, and Body Parts to these Test Maps in the future should the Razor devices upgrade to include a wider array of body targets to vibrate. We can also adjust and experiment the best linear interpolation experience by adding different formulas to achieve the most organic vibration transition for a particular in-game event or scene.

The Spatial Interpolation map allows us to experience proximity-based sensations, where the intensity of the vibration changes with distance. Players can “feel” if an enemy explosion is approaching or receding or if a grenade explosion if close to you or further away. This enhances spatial awareness. This is particularly useful in fast-paced games/ E-sports as it helps players react faster to threats and changes in the environment as players are more aware of the direction and position based on the vibrations they feel on their body.
